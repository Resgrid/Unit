# Audio Service Implementation

## Overview
The audio service has been updated to play connection and disconnection sounds directly in the application using `expo-audio` instead of the notification system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies
- **Added**: `expo-audio` for direct audio playback
- **Removed**: Dependency on `expo-notifications` for audio playback

### 2. Audio Files
The service now uses the existing audio files located in:
- **Connection Sound**: `assets/audio/ui/space_notification1.mp3`
- **Disconnection Sound**: `assets/audio/ui/space_notification2.mp3`

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Audio Initialization
```typescript
private async initializeAudio(): Promise<void> {
  // Configure audio mode for playback
  await Audio.setAudioModeAsync({
    allowsRecordingIOS: false,
    staysActiveInBackground: false,
    playsInSilentModeIOS: true,
    shouldDuckAndroid: true,
    playThroughEarpieceAndroid: false,
  });

  // Pre-load audio files
  await this.loadAudioFiles();
}
```

#### Sound Loading
- Audio files are preloaded during service initialization
- Both iOS and Android use the same `.mp3` files
- Sounds are stored as class properties for efficient reuse

#### Sound Playback
- Uses `sound.replayAsync()` for direct playback
- Includes proper error handling and logging
- Plays sounds immediately without notification system overhead

#### Resource Management
- Proper cleanup in the `cleanup()` method
- Unloads audio files to prevent memory leaks
- Null checks to prevent errors during cleanup

### 4. Benefits

1. **Direct Playback**: Sounds play immediately without notification system delays
2. **Better Control**: More control over audio playback behavior
3. **Reduced Dependencies**: No longer depends on notification permissions for audio
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Same audio behavior across iOS and Android
5. **Resource Efficient**: Preloaded sounds for faster playback

### 5. Usage

The API remains the same:

```typescript
// Play connection sound
await audioService.playConnectionSound();

// Play disconnection sound
await audioService.playDisconnectionSound();

// Cleanup when done
await audioService.cleanup();
```

### 6. Error Handling

The service includes comprehensive error handling:
- Initialization errors are logged but don't crash the app
- Sound loading errors are handled gracefully
- Playback errors are logged with context
- Cleanup errors are handled to prevent resource leaks

### 7. Testing

The service includes unit tests that verify:
- Proper initialization
- Sound playback functionality
- Error handling
- Resource cleanup

## Migration Notes

The change is backward compatible - existing code using `playConnectionSound()` and `playDisconnectionSound()` will continue to work without modification, but now with improved performance and reliability.
