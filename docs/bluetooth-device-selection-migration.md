# Bluetooth Device Selection Dialog Migration to react-native-ble-manager

## Overview

The Bluetooth device selection dialog has been updated to support the migration from `react-native-ble-plx` to `react-native-ble-manager` in the bluetooth audio service.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Scan Error Recovery**: Added reset of `hasScanned` state on scan errors to allow retry
- **Connection Error Display**: Added display of connection errors from the bluetooth store
- **Bluetooth State Handling**: Improved bluetooth state warnings with specific messages for different states

### 2. Auto-Connect Functionality
- **Smart Device Selection**: When a device is selected as preferred, the dialog now attempts to automatically connect to it if not already connected
- **Non-blocking Connection**: Connection failures during selection don't block the preference setting - they're logged as warnings

### 3. Enhanced Device Information Display
- **Audio Capability Badge**: Added display of `hasAudioCapability` property for devices
- **Connection Status**: Enhanced display of connection status in the selected device section
- **Better Device Metadata**: Improved display of device capabilities and connection state

### 4. Improved Scanning Management
- **Automatic Scan Cleanup**: Added cleanup to stop scanning when dialog closes or component unmounts
- **Scan State Management**: Better handling of scan state to prevent memory leaks

### 5. Updated Dependencies and Imports
- **Store Compatibility**: Updated to use `connectionError` from the bluetooth store
- **Type Safety**: Maintained compatibility with the new `BluetoothAudioDevice` interface from react-native-ble-manager

### 6. Testing Infrastructure
- **Mock Creation**: Created new mock for `react-native-ble-manager` to replace old `react-native-ble-plx` mock
- **Icon Mocking**: Added proper mocking for lucide icons to avoid SVG-related test failures
- **Comprehensive Tests**: Added tests for new functionality including error states and auto-connect behavior

## Compatibility Notes

### What Stayed the Same
- **Component Interface**: The component props and public API remain unchanged
- **UI/UX**: The visual design and user interaction patterns are maintained
- **Core Functionality**: Device selection and preference setting work exactly as before

### What Changed Internally
- **Service Integration**: Now properly integrates with the migrated bluetooth service using react-native-ble-manager
- **Error Handling**: More robust error handling and user feedback
- **State Management**: Better state cleanup and scanning lifecycle management

## Migration Benefits

1. **Better Reliability**: Improved error handling and state management
2. **Enhanced UX**: Auto-connect functionality and better status display
3. **Improved Performance**: Better scan lifecycle management prevents memory leaks
4. **Future-Proof**: Compatible with the new react-native-ble-manager architecture

## Technical Details

### New Properties Used
- `hasAudioCapability`: Displayed as a badge for audio-capable devices
- `connectionError`: Shown in error display section
- Enhanced bluetooth state handling with specific error messages

### Enhanced Functionality
- **Auto-connect on selection**: Attempts to connect when device is selected as preferred
- **Scan cleanup**: Properly stops scanning when dialog closes
- **Error recovery**: Better error handling with retry capabilities

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite covering all new functionality
- Added mocks for react-native-ble-manager compatibility
- Tests cover error states, auto-connect behavior, and scan management

The updated dialog is now fully compatible with the react-native-ble-manager migration while providing enhanced functionality and better user experience.
