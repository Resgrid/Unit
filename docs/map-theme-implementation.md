# Map Theme Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of light/dark theme support for the map component in the Resgrid Unit app.

## Changes Made

### 1. Map Component Updates (`src/app/(app)/index.tsx`)

#### Theme Integration
- Imported `useColorScheme` from `nativewind` for theme detection
- Added `getMapStyle()` function that returns appropriate Mapbox style based on current theme:
  - **Light mode**: `Mapbox.StyleURL.Street` (professional, muted appearance)
  - **Dark mode**: `Mapbox.StyleURL.Dark` (dark theme optimized for low light)

#### Dynamic Styling
- Created `getThemedStyles()` function for theme-aware component styling
- Updated marker and recenter button styles to adapt to theme:
  - **Light mode**: White borders and dark shadows
  - **Dark mode**: Dark borders and light shadows

#### Analytics Enhancement
- Added theme information to analytics tracking
- Map view rendered events now include current theme data

#### Map Style Updates
- Map style now automatically updates when theme changes
- Added `useEffect` to watch for theme changes and update map style accordingly

### 2. Test Updates (`src/app/(app)/__tests__/index.test.tsx`)

#### Mock Enhancements
- Updated `useColorScheme` mock to include proper interface
- Added support for testing both light and dark themes
- Enhanced Mapbox mock to include Light and Dark style URLs

#### New Test Cases
- **Light theme test**: Verifies map renders correctly in light mode
- **Dark theme test**: Verifies map renders correctly in dark mode  
- **Theme change test**: Verifies smooth transition between themes
- **Analytics test**: Verifies theme information is tracked in analytics

## Available Map Styles

| Theme | Mapbox Style | URL | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----|-------------|
| Light | `Mapbox.StyleURL.Street` | `mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v11` | Professional street map with balanced colors |
| Dark | `Mapbox.StyleURL.Dark` | `mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v10` | Dark theme optimized for low light |

## Theme Detection

The component uses the `useColorScheme` hook from `nativewind` which provides:
- Current theme: `'light' | 'dark' | undefined`
- Theme setter function
- Automatic system theme detection

## User Experience

### Light Mode
- Professional street map appearance suitable for all lighting conditions
- Balanced contrast with clear, readable text and features
- Consistent with the call detail view's static map styling
- Muted colors that reduce eye strain compared to bright white themes

### Dark Mode  
- Reduced brightness for low-light environments
- Dark backgrounds with light accents
- Eye-strain reduction for nighttime usage

### Automatic Switching
- Theme changes are applied immediately without restart
- Smooth transitions between light and dark styles
- Maintains map position and zoom during theme changes

## Testing Coverage

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Basic map rendering
- ✅ Light theme functionality  
- ✅ Dark theme functionality
- ✅ Theme switching behavior
- ✅ Analytics integration with theme data

## Technical Notes

- Map style updates are handled through React state (`styleURL`)
- Theme-aware styling uses `useCallback` for performance optimization
- Analytics tracking includes theme context for usage insights
- Component maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- **Style Choice**: Uses `Street` style for light mode instead of `Light` style to match the professional appearance of the call detail view's static map and reduce visual brightness

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Custom map styles for better brand integration
- Theme-specific marker colors
- Transition animations during theme changes
- User preference persistence across app restarts
