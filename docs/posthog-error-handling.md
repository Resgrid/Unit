# PostHog Error Handling Implementation

## Problem

The application was experiencing network errors when PostHog tried to flush analytics data:

```
Error while flushing PostHog [PostHogFetchNetworkError: Network error while fetching PostHog]
```

## Solution

Implemented a comprehensive error handling system for PostHog network failures:

### 1. PostHog Service (`src/services/posthog.service.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Centralized error handling and retry logic for PostHog
- **Features**:
  - Tracks retry attempts (default: 3 max retries)
  - Temporarily disables PostHog after max retries
  - Automatic re-enabling after 5 minutes
  - Comprehensive logging of errors and state changes

### 2. PostHog Provider Wrapper (`src/components/common/posthog-provider.tsx`)

- **Purpose**: Wraps the PostHog provider with error handling
- **Features**:
  - Catches console errors related to PostHog
  - Uses the PostHog service for error management
  - Gracefully falls back to rendering without PostHog when disabled
  - Conservative configuration to reduce network calls

### 3. Updated Layout (`src/app/_layout.tsx`)

- **Purpose**: Uses the new PostHog wrapper instead of direct PostHog provider
- **Change**: Replaced `PostHogProvider` with `PostHogProviderWrapper`

## Key Features

### Graceful Degradation

- When PostHog encounters network errors, the app continues to function normally
- Analytics are temporarily disabled rather than causing app crashes
- User experience remains unaffected

### Automatic Recovery

- PostHog is automatically re-enabled after 5 minutes
- Retry counter is reset upon recovery
- System logs recovery events for monitoring

### Conservative Configuration

- Reduced flush frequency (60 seconds instead of 10)
- Smaller batch sizes (10 events instead of 20)
- 10-second request timeout
- Comprehensive error logging

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests:

### PostHog Service Tests (`src/services/__tests__/posthog.service.test.ts`)

- Error handling logic
- Retry mechanism
- Disable/enable functionality
- Status tracking
- Timer-based recovery

### PostHog Provider Tests (`src/components/common/__tests__/posthog-provider.test.tsx`)

- Component rendering with PostHog enabled/disabled
- Error handling integration
- Configuration validation
- Navigation ref support
- Service integration

All tests pass successfully and provide good coverage of the error handling functionality.

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: App no longer crashes due to PostHog network errors
2. **User Experience**: Seamless operation even when analytics fail
3. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging for debugging
4. **Performance**: Reduced network calls and optimized configuration
5. **Resilience**: Automatic recovery from network issues

## Configuration

The system uses environment variables for PostHog configuration:

- `POSTHOG_API_KEY`: PostHog API key
- `POSTHOG_HOST`: PostHog server URL (default: https://us.i.posthog.com)

When no API key is provided, the app runs without PostHog entirely.
